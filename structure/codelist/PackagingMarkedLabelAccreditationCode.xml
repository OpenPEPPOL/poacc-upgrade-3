   the
         ACMI certification seal.

      <cl:Description>
         The products marked with the Bio-Zeichen Baden-Württemberg are regional organic foods with
         a traceable origin. The use or labelling is based on the ecological standards of the EC
   Organic
         Regulation supplemented with the requirement that the products must be produced in fully
   converted farms and, in part, on the more stringent requirements of the organic farming
   associations. The regional origin of the products ensures an additional ecological advantage of
   the products. The rationality promotes short transport and marketing channels. The independent
   checks of food by authorized inspection bodies and the additional supervision by the sign holder
   ensure a high degree of credibility of the sign. The control number printed on the products makes
   the controls comprehensible.
         The seal clearly shows the consumer that the agricultural products and products come from
   Baden-Württemberg. This ensures not only that the processing takes place in the region, but also
   that the sourcing of raw materials is 100% regional. In the production and processing of food,
         the guidelines of the EU Organic Regulation are used as the basis. Many products that are
   labelled with the Baden-Württemberg organic label are also produced according to the stricter
   guidelines of an organic farming association. The farms participating in the Bio-Zeichen
   Baden-Württemberg must be 100% organic. A partial conversion is - with the exception of products
   from the orchard - not permitted. Neutral controls ensure compliance with the guidelines.

         In 2010, the organic Label - HESSEN was supplemented by another appendix: the European
         Union logo for organically produced products.
         This allows companies to use only one logo on the packaging of their products instead of
   three different logos, because the European organic label is required.
         Behind the Bio-Seal - HESSEN, similar to the quality mark "Tested Quality - HESSEN", there
   are special requirements for producers, processors and marketers regarding the quality and
   traceable origin of their products.

      <cl:Description>
         The Blue-White-Heart approach was born between 1993 and 2000, from a simple observation
         made by a dairy farmer, Jean Pierre Pasquet to an agricultural engineer, Pierre Weill. He
   explained to him that he noticed that in the spring, when his cows were in pasture grass, they
   were in better shape, and the butter he made was softer and more spreadable than in winter.
         From this observation, Jean-Pierre Pasquet and Pierre Weill began their reflection on the
   importance of preserving the food chain and valuing plants and seeds of nutritional interest.
   Together, they created an agriculture committed to a sustainable and social approach with
         breeders eager to feed their fellow citizens."

      <cl:Description>The French agricultural organizations have created a common visual identity in
   order to highlight the French origin of agricultural products in this case fruit and legumes: the
   signatures "Agricultural Products of France".
         Remarkable to their elegant silhouette in a tricolor pentagon that is available for each
   family of products, these signatures reflect the commitment of the professionals of the sectors
         to value the know-how, the territories and the French jobs.

         Covering a variety of productions, these signatures all have a common basis, which consists
   of four criteria:

         Origin France of the products concerned,
         The existence of specifications or regulations governing the use of the logo,
         A formal commitment from the operators of the sectors concerned wishing to use these logos,
   Controls performed by a third party.

      <cl:Name>ORIGINE_FRANCE_GARANTIE</cl:Name>
      <cl:Description>The Origine France Garantie certification was created in June 2010 following
   the publication of Yves Jégo's report on the France brand.
         The certification, simple and understandable by all, is the result of a collective approach
   of actors who wish to work together to promote the "produce in France" and the valorization of
   industrial and artisan know-how.

         The Pro France association which promotes Origine France Garantie is made up of business
   leaders supporting this initiative. Its goal is:

         Give clear and precise information to the consumer about the French origin of the products
   Make known the companies that manufacture in France
         The Origine France Garantie certification distinguishes itself from other mentions such as
   "made in France", "designed in France", "Made in France" ... which are self-declarative and too
   loose.

         Origine France Garantie is the only certification that certifies the French origin of a
   product. It is transversal (all sectors combined) and indisputable (certification, mandatory, is
   carried out by an independent certifying body).

         The Origine France Garantie certification ensures consumers traceability of the product by
   giving a clear and objective indication of origin.
