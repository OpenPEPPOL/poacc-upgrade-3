= Interoperability

This BIS structure is based on the European Interoperability Framework 2.0 {EIF}. This BIS applies the Framework as follows:

Legal Interoperability::

* Legal:
** In implementations supporting public sector buyers, the use of this BIS has to be monitored in order to secure that the parties act in line with EU procurement directives.


Organizational interoperability::

* Organization (Organization/Business):
** This BIS supports B2B and B2G.
** This BIS supports cross border, regional and domestic ordering.
** This BIS can function as a component in an EDI agreement within a trading community.
** This BIS supports linking of business processes within the sending and receiving organization.
The process of order transmission in electronic form can be linked into internal processes of both sender and receiver, which may differ for various reasons.

* Organization (Process):
** This BIS supports a set of “common business processes” that is assumed to be supported by most enterprises whether public or private. These are processes that are used widely or understood as being relevant for most companies.


Semantic interoperability::
* Semantic:
The set of information elements is assumed to be sufficient to support organizational business and processing requirements stated above.


** A CORE business message:
*** Data model, a set of elements that the receiver MUST be able to process.
*** Business rules, a set of business rules that ensure a common way of processing the information elements.
The rules are stated in a way that allows for automated validation of document instances.
Issuers and receivers can verify that the exchanged document conforms to the rules of this BIS. +
Peppol adds business rules on top of the data model to clarify certain design choices left open by the {bii}.
These choices are intended to lower the implementation threshold by limiting options for implementers and thereby increase interoperability of Peppol transactions.

Technical interoperability::
* Technical Interaction (Process and semantic implementation):
** Binding to OASIS UBL 2.1, see {ubl21} (for Order transaction)
** Binding to OASIS UBL 2.3, see {ubl23} (for other transactions)
** ISO/IEC 19757-3 Schematron, for automation of document validation, see {schematron}


* Technical Interaction (eSignature Validation):
** Not supported in this BIS.
