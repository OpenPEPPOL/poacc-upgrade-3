= Code lists for coded elements

Any element with the semantic data type = *code*, can mandate the use of a specific code list (or a fixed value). The applicable code lists can be found in the {link-codelist}. In this section, you can find the valid codes, their names and description, and also links to where the same code list is used elsewhere in the transaction, or in other Peppol BIS v3. documents.
