== Use case 3 - Despatch with Logistic units using GS1 Keys

This use case is a refined use of the Despatch Advice where several GS1 keys are applied within the Despatch Advice to identify various entities in the despatch advice, namely; Parties, Endpoints, Shipment id, consignment ids, logistic unit ids and product identification.

|====
|*Use Case number* |3
|*Use Case Name* |Despatch Advice with Logistic units using GS1 Keys
|*Use Case Description* a|
Describes a complete process whereby a Despatch party generates a Despatch Advice based on information about the order and the product.

The Despatch Advice enables the supplier (carrier) to provide detailed information about the content of a shipment and enables a Buyer to reconcile, or confirm, the physical shipment against the order; it provides a mirror of the shipment’s packaging details and structure of the delivery.

The Despatch Advice is sent by the Despatch party to the Consignee party when the goods are sent.

|*Parties involved* a|
Despatch party In UBL: DespatchSupplierParty) (Different legal entity than the Seller in this use case)

Seller (In UBL: SellerSupplierParty)

Consignee party (In UBL: DeliveryCustomerParty) (Different legal entity than the Buyer in this use)

Buyer (In UBL: BuyerCustomerParty)

|*Pre conditions* |Master data alignment of locations (GLNs) and products (GTINs).
|*Post conditions* |Despatch advice is received by the receiver of the goods.
|*Assumptions* a|
[loweralpha]
..  The Despatch Advice has one shipment id (GSIN) assigned by the seller
..  The Despatch Advice has one consignment id which has been assigned by the carrier (GINC)
..  One delivery point (no cross docking) which is identified by a GLN.
..  The four despatch lines are each an orderable unit – a GTIN.
..  Two ordered units (GTINS) are packed on each pallet.
..  There are two pallets in the shipment.
..  Each standard pallet is assigned one logistics’ unit id (SSCC).
..  A logistics’ label has been applied to each of the pallets where the SSCC is used rendered as clear text numbers, address details and GS1 128 barcode

|*The flow* a|
The Seller has accepted the order without changes.

.  The Seller collects the ordered goods
.  The ordered goods consist of one pallet per ordered 2 line items.
.  The Despatch party loads the goods onto the transport.
.  The Despatch party sends the Despatch advice to the Consignee
.  The Consignee party receives the Despatch advice message

1.  The Consignee party uses the content in the Despatch advice message for registration receipt.

|*Result* a|
.  The Despatch advice message helped the Consignee party to prepare for receipt of goods:
..  At the right time
..  At the right location (address)
.  The Despatch advice helped the Consignee party in the process of receipt registration to identify the:
..  Order
..  The order lines
..  The logistics’ handling units
..  The goods description
..  The delivered quantity
..  The parties involved in the process

The following provides additional details and clarifications about the various keys and identifiers used in this Use Case, as well as the benefits implementers can obtain when using them.
Ultimately there are two pictures clarifying the relationship between the GSIN and the GINC identifiers.

2+|Beneath are an overview and an explanation of the keys used in the Use Case.
a|

*GLN:*

Global location number |

Despatch party - Organizational identification.

Despatch party - Endpoint identification

Consignee - Organizational identification.

Consignee - Endpoint identification

Buyer - Organizational identification.

Seller - Organizational identification

a|
**SSCC**:

Serial Shipping Container Code

 a|
Each transport handling unit is assigned an SSCC.

The SSCC is the GS1 Identification Key for an item of any composition established for transport and/or storage which needs to be managed through the supply chain.
The SSCC is assigned for the life time of the transport item and is a mandatory element on the GS1 Logistic Label

a|
*GSIN:*

Global Shipment Identification Number

 a|
Shipment identification. One shipment number for the despatch advice.

A document level id that specifies the number of the Shipment along the entire shipment, which, may consist of several consignments.

* Number assigned by the seller to identify a logical grouping of logistic or transport units that are typically assembled by the seller for a transport shipment.

* It meets the World Customs Organisation (WCO) requirement for a Unique Consignment Reference (URC).

It is endorsed by ISO/IEC 15459 (ISO License Plate)

a|
*GINC:*

Global Identification Number of Consignment

 a|
One consignment number for the Despatch Advice

* Used to identify a logical grouping of logistic or transport units that are assembled to be transported under one transport document.

* It is used to identify a logical grouping of logistic units during a specific journey of which there may be multiple consignment stages.


a|
*GTIN:*

Global trade Item Number

 a|
Each ordered item as a GTIN.

Product identification.

2+|Beneath are an overview of the benefits implementers can get when using the keys and identifiers.
|
*GTIN:*

Global trade Item Number

a|
* Correct goods and associated data have been sourced through upfront data alignment

|
*GLN*

Global Location Number

a|
* Precise and trustworthy location data has been achieved through GS1 master data alignment location registers.

|
*SSCC:*

Serial Shipping Container Code

a|
* Logistic units are individually identified with the SSCC (Serial Shipping Container Code)
* The item (goods) details accessed by scanning (bar code) or reading (EPC/RFID) the SSCC on the logistic unit and accessing the relevant information.
* The usage of the SSCC on a logistic unit is subject to rules, namely that multiple visible SSCCs on one logistics unit can only be used for transit purposes.
** If two or more SSCCs are applied on a logistics unit then the units associated to a given SSCC have to be individually wrapped or bound together to form individual logistics units.
** Multiple SSCCs can be applied to individual units on one logistic unit for subsequent cross docking but they HAVE to be wrapped so that they are not visible.
* Additionally, a master logistics label needs to be applied to the whole logistics unit for the consignment to the distribution center.
a|
**GSIN**:

Global Shipment Identification Number

a|
* A globally recognised shipping number used to uniquely identify the shipment as a whole as specified by the seller

|
*GINC:*

Global Identification Number of Consignment

a|
* A globally recognised consignment number used to uniquely identify the consignment as specified by the shipper.
