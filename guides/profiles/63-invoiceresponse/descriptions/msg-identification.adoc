<1> The message is based on the Peppol transaction specification for transaction 111 and should therefore comply with the rules defined in that specification.
<2> The profile ID states that the transaction is part of business process number 63 which is the Invoice Response process.
<3> The identifier for this message, i.e. the identifier for this Invoice Response message, not the identifier of the invoice that is being responded to.
