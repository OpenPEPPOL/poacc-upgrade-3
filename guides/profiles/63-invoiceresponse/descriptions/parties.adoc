[[sending-and-receiving-parties]]
= Sending and receiving parties

The sending and receiving parties are those that exchange the Invoice Response.
These may be the Buyer and the Seller or service providers acting on their behalf.

[[senderparty]]
== SenderParty

The party that sends the Invoice Response.
This may be the Buyer who received the invoice, or it may be a service provider processing the invoice on behalf of the Buyer.
If the Invoice Response is issued by a service provider the name of the actual Buyer may be given with the invoice reference.

The information given for the sender is his EndpointID which is his Peppol Participant Identifier (PPID). The party identifier may be given as well and the schema that the identifier is based on.
The name of the sender is then provided.

Contact information for the sender (Buyer) is the person that the receiver (Seller) can contact when resolving an issue reported in the Invoice Response.
This should not be general company email and phone unless the sender has in place a process that would direct the contact efficiently to a relevant person.

== ReceiverParty

The party that sent the Invoice that the IMR is responding to.
This is also the receiver of the Invoice Response.

[[issuer-and-recipient-parties]]
== Issuer and Recipient parties

In the case when the Invoice processing is handled by a service provider on behalf or the Buyer or the Seller then the sending/receiving party is not the Buyer/Seller stated in the Invoice document.
In those cases, it is required to identify the Buyer and the Seller as declared in the referenced Invoice.
This shall be done by giving an identifier and a name.

<cac:IssuerParty>
  <cac:PartyIdentification>
