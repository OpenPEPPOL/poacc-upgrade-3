= Invoice Response message in general

From the creation of an electronic message, down the transport line that goes through one or more transport networks, to the designated receiver and all way through the eventual processing of the message content; there may be a need to give responses to the relevant parties up-line about the status or results of the actions that the message goes through.
These responses are of different nature but in the scope of this document they can be divided into the following main groups.

== Transport acknowledgements

These are messages that are exchanged within the transport network(s) to inform about the process of carrying a message down the transport line.
These responses may inform someone up-line whether the delivery to a given point was successful or not and may contain details about issues that are relevant such as why a delivery was not successful.
The key nature of these responses is that they do not in any way act on the result of validation or processing of the content of the payload that is being transported.
These response messages are commonly called “acks” (short for acknowledgements) and in Peppol they are part of the transport protocol of the {peppol} network ({peppol-transport}) (e.g. as MDN – Message Disposition Notification – in AS2).

== Business Level Responses

A message that has been received and assigned to processing may call for an action on the receiver’s behalf.
That receiver’s action may need to be reported back up-line to a relevant party.
An example is that a technically correct invoice may be received but the receiver decides to dispute the invoice for any business reason such as incorrect values, delivery issues etc.
The key nature of these responses is that they report a business decision that is made on the message instance received by the Receiver.
Business level responses may have a role in the processing of various document types other than invoices.
