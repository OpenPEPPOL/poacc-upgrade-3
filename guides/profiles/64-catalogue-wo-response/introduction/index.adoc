= Introduction to OpenPeppol and BIS

This BIS is a result of work within OpenPeppol and is published as part of the Peppol specifications.

This Peppol BIS provides a set of specifications for implementing a Peppol business process.
The document is concerned with clarifying requirements for ensuring interoperability of pan-European Public eProcurement and provides guidelines for supporting these requirements and how to implement them.
This Peppol BIS is based on the CEN WS/BII2 “Profile BII01 Catalogue Only”.

*The purpose* of this document is to describe a common format for the catalogue message in the European market, and to facilitate an efficient implementation and increased use of electronic collaboration regarding the sourcing process based on this format.
