The Order process flow can be described as follows:

* A Buyer submits an Order to the Seller requesting for delivery of goods or services
* An Order may refer to a framework agreement for its terms and conditions; otherwise the Buyerâ€™s terms and conditions apply.
* An Order may contain items (goods or services) with item identifiers or items with free text description.
