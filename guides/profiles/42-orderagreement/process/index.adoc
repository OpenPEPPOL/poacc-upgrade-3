= Process and typical use cases

The order agreement BIS includes the sending of information on agreed products/services from a Seller to a Buyer.

== Process flow

The order agreement process flow can be described as follows:

.Possible start positions:
. A Buyer makes a purchase of goods or services from the Seller.
. A Seller reports one or more accumulated purchases made under a framework agreement to the Buyer.

.End positions:
. A purchase has been recorded in the Buyer´s purchasing system. The seller proceeds to invoice accordingly.

An Order Agreement may refer to a framework agreement for its terms and conditions; otherwise the Buyer’s terms and conditions apply.
