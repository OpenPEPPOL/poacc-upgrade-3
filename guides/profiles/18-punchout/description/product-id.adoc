[[product-identification]]
= Product identification

Which identifier to use depends on what is known at the time of ordering or what is commonly used in the relevant business sector.

IMPORTANT: Each cart line MUST have an item name and an identifier.

Product identification must be done using one or both of the identifiers described below:

* Sellers ID
* Standard ID, e.g. the GS1 Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) used by the seller

Manufacturers item identification can not be used alone to identify a product.
