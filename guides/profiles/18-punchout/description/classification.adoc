A shopping cart line may give information about the classification of items eg. UNSPSC code

A shopping cart line may give information about labels and certifications that apply to the item.
Examples of such are environmental, health, social, quality, cultural and so fort.
For each label the name of the label must be given and the certificate of the label as well.
If a label has no levels it is recommended to set the type as active.

Due to UBL syntax requirements (see {ubl-catalogue}) the tags `cbc:CertificateTypeCode` and `cac:IssuerParty` must also be included when the certificate class is used.

These elements are not required by this Peppol BIS but in order to comply with the syntax requirement it is recommended to fill in the elements with the word "NA".
