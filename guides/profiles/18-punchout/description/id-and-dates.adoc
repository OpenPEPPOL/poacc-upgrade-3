= Identification and dates.

In the beginning of the shopping cart message there is information that identifies the shopping cart itself which allows for managing it in a processing flow as well as referencing it from other documents and processes.
This is given by an identifier as well as the date and time when the shopping cart message is created.
This would normally be the time when the buyer punches out from the sellers web store.

The identifier is created by the seller and may be of any format.
The issue date and time must not be in the future.
