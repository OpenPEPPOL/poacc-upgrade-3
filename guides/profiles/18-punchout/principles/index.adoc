= Principles and prerequisites

This chapter describes the principles and assumptions that underlie the use of this Peppol BIS Punch out.
It is based on the {bii} 18 Punch out.

This document identifies, explains and justifies the business requirements for the Punch Out-process.
It provides syntax bindings to {ubl} (Universal Business Language). It also includes a syntax implementation guide.

The Punch Out BIS describes a process where the buyer accesses the sellerâ€™s web-based catalogue, and adds and/or configures items (such as a PC) to a product or service list.
The product- or service lists are sent to the buyers procurement system, and can later be used as a basis for an order or an item comparison in the buyers catalogue tool.
The order is prepared and sent from the buyers procurement system, not from the sellers website.
