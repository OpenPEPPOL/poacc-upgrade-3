This Peppol BIS is based on the CEN WS/BII Profile “BII Profile 28 Ordering” {bii-ordering}.

*The purpose* of this document is to describe a common format for the order and order response message in the European market, and to facilitate an efficient implementation and increased use of electronic collaboration regarding the ordering process based on these formats.
