[horizontal]
Release date:: 2020-11-09

== Changes to syntax
* Corrected cardinality of cac:DespatchLine/cac:OrderLineReference/cac:OrderLine to 0..1 instead of 1..1 in Despatch Advice in line with BIS specification.[POACC-347]

== Changes to code lists and validation artefacts
* Removed rule PEPPOL-T16-R002 that triggered a warning when cac:OrderReference/cbc:ID in DespatchAdvice was absent [POACC-347]

== Changes to previous release notes
* A release note in version 3.0.5 was incorrect, the correct release note shall state:
* For the Catalogue (T19) cac:Price/cac:ValidityPeriod (tir19-056/057) is marked as unbounded in the syntax description while the validation rules and BIS description expects maximum 1. Cardinality changed to 0..1 to align with requirements and business rules. [POACC-340]
