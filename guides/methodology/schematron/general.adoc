<1> binding to xslt2

= Patterns

Different patterns should be provided, suggestion is to have 3 different patterns (if applicable):

. Transaction rules
. National rules

= Parameters

Parameters can be stated either globally or locally within one rule.
We recommend to use parameters for amounts, where the casting to decimals is done. This way the rule test when used within a calculation is easier to read.

= Functions

Functions can be created to do checking of calculations, like the example below:

= Rules

In Peppol we only use assertions, not report when creating the rules.

All asserts must have an `id` attribute with the identifier of the rule
IMPORTANT: this must be unique within one schematron file

In addition, the `test` attribute must be present, as well as the `flag` attribute. The `flag` attribute must contain either the value "fatal" or "warning".

The error-message is the content of the `assert`- element, and should not be prefixed with the identifier.
