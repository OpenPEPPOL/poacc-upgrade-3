= Peppol Identifiers

Peppol has defined a {policy8} that specifies how to use identifiers in both
its transport infrastructure and within the documents exchanged across that infrastructure. It also introduces
principles for any identifiers used in the Peppol environment. The policies that apply to this BIS are the
following:


== Profiles and messages [[profiles]]

All messages contains ProfileID and CustomizationID. ProfileID identifies what business process a given message is part of, and CustomizationID identifies the kind of message and the rules applied.

Profiles are connected to one business process, and may contain multiple document types. Valid document instances shall contain corresponding ProfileID and CustomizationID.


IMPORTANT: CustomizationID is a string without spaces. The list below contains spaces in CustomizationID to make them easier to read. *Make sure to remove any spaces before use.*
